WiFi Password Cracker

This Python script utilizes the PyWiFi library to perform WiFi password cracking. It allows users to specify the SSID of the target WiFi network and the path to a password wordlist file, or prompts for user input if not provided via command-line arguments.
Features:

    Connects to a WiFi network using the provided SSID and password from a wordlist file.
    Supports both command-line arguments and interactive user input for flexibility.
    Uses ANSI color codes for colored output, enhancing readability and user experience.
    Provides feedback on the cracking process, including success or failure to crack the password.

Usage:

    Clone the repository or download the script.
    Install the required libraries (pywifi).
    Run the script with the desired SSID and password wordlist file path as command-line arguments, or follow the interactive prompts.

Note: Ensure you have permission to perform WiFi password cracking on the target network, as unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
